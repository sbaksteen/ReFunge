# ReFunge

ReFunge is a mostly spec-compliant Funge-98 interpreter written in C#.
It can be used as a library or as a standalone program.

Also included in this repository is ReFunge Editor, a simple editor and debugger for Funge-98 programs. 
It lets you view Funge-Space, IP and stack data, and other useful variables during execution.
The editing functionality is still in development, but it can be used for debugging purposes.

## Features

- Support for the core Funge-98 language
- File I/O and concurrency are supported
- Currently supported fingerprints:
  - `NULL`, `ROMA`, `MODU`
  - More to come!
- Supports arbitrary n-dimensional Euclidean Funges (with Lahey-space wrapping).
- ReFunge Editor:
  - Load and debug Befunge-98 programs
  - View Funge-space, IP, stack, output, and other variables
  - Step through the program or execute it at a set speed (up to 100 instructions per frame)

Breakpoints and Trefunge support in the Editor are planned for the future.

## Usage

Will be added soon.
